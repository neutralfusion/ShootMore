Android Application based on Java that represents a store where you can book an appointment for a photoshoot, browse the photo gallery and buy prints and merchandise.

## Brief description of the application and the motivation behind it:

The app itself will be an online portal where you can reach my services as a photographer (actually this is my primary job, also this subject being the motivation
creating this application), view my portfolio and also ordering prints and different merchandise. 
I found out that developing such an app will increase my skills in Android Development as well as promoting my work and helping my business to grow in real
life as a photographer.

I started devevloping this application at the beggining from a different pathway, more exactly using the Kotlin language from what I've tried in the past
but in the end (which happens to be a bit too late) I started developing it in Java and decided to follow the path taught in the class (from the Codelabs 
lectures). In present I will try to make two separate apps, a basic one with basic functionalities without any big UX/UI design expectations and the one in
Kotlin with the complete interface and functionalities.

## Requirements 

### Critical:
- Login page where the user can login;
- App should run on Firebase;
- The ability to add products on the shop (only the administrator can use this feature).

### High:
- App should run on 99% of devices (the correct API adaptaions pathway will be followed);
- Ability to book appointments via direct message or Contact page;

### Low: 
- Having a responsive layout on the photo gallery app (egg.: the image should be automatically resized after different sized images will be added)
- Working payment method for different prints or merchandise. 


### Non-functional requirements:
- The application can be translated in english, danish;
- Material Design principles will be respected.
